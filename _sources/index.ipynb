    "*And therefore is wing’d Cupid painted blind.*         \n",
    "*Nor hath love’s mind of any judgment taste.*       \n",
    "*Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste.*      \n",
    "*And therefore is love said to be a child,*     \n",
    "*Because in choice he is so oft beguil’d.*      \n",
    "*As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,*     \n",
    "*So the boy Love is perjur’d everywhere.*       \n",

    "Love marinates the mind to \"see\", think, and act in a certain way. A neural scientist would consider this a \"top-down\" modulation of sensory input. Phew!\n",

    "This book explores the human mind through such strokes of luck as poetry, dialogue, and music. Welcome!"
